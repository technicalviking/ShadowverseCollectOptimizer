Recently I've been playing a cardgame called Shadowverse.  After a conversation with a friend of mine, I decided to find out what it would take to complete the entire collection, as far as how many packs would be required.  Cygames is nice enough to have published the odds of each card rarity, so I took a few hours to throw together some scenarios I could compare to see the number of packs required to accomplish the goal.

More copy-pasting than I would normally do, since at the end I ran into unexpected ideas as to ways to modify things, and I didn't want to re-architect it any further.

The scenarios and strategies are far from the complete list of possible approaches, but are enough to indicate a trend towards ideal collection strategies.
